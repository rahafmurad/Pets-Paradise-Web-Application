<ul>
       <li >Canine distemper</li>
              <p> Canine distemper, sometimes called hardpad disease because <br>it hardens dogs’ noses and footpads, is an extremely contagious <br>viral disease that’s transmitted through airborne exposure or <br> contact like shared food bowls. While all dogs are at risk of<br> contractingcanine distemper, it predominantly affects puppies<br> and dogs that are especially prone to airborne viruses.

       <br><br><li> Canine parvovirus (parvo)</li>
       <p>Parvo is another highly contagious virus that  infects dogs that come<br> in contact with the fecal matter of a sick dog. And, sadly, parvo’s <br>easy to spread but hard to kill, once it attacks a dog’s internal organs.

         <br><br><li> Heartworm</li>
         <p>Heartworms are parasites that live in your dog’s heart, wreaking havoc<br> on his heart, blood vessels and lungs if he gets infected. Heartworm is spread <br>by mosquitos and has been reported in all fifty states, not just places with dry <br> climates. Buying preventative medication (like heartworm or flea and tick) <br>is comparable to buying insurance — while you may not want to spend money <br>on it now, it’s better than not being able to afford a crisis later. Here are some<br> more money-saving hacks for pet owners.

 <h1>Famous Cat Diseases</h1>

<ul>
       <li>Diabetes</li>
       <p>Diabetes in cats is a complex disease caused by either a lack of the hormone<br> insulin or an inadequate response to insulin. After a cat eats, her digestive <br> system breaks food into various components, including glucose—which is<br> carried into her cells by insulin. When a cat does not produce insulin or cannot<br> utilize it normally, her blood sugar levels elevate. The result is hyperglycemia,<br> which, if left untreated, can cause many complicated health problems for a cat.</p>

      <br><br> <li> Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)</li>
      <p>Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may not show symptoms <br>until years after the initial infection occurred. Although the virus is slow-acting,<br> a cat’s immune system is severely weakened once the disease takes hold.<br> This makes the cat susceptible to various secondary infections. Infected cats <br>receiving supportive medical care and kept in a stress-free, indoor environment <br> can live relatively comfortable lives for months to years before the disease reaches<br> its chronic stages.</p>

         <br><br><li> Feline Leukemia Virus (FelV)</li>
         <p>First discovered in the 1960s, feline leukemia virus is a transmittable RNA retrovirus<br> that can severely inhibit a cat’s immune system. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed <br>causes of disease and death in domestic cats. Because the virus doesn’t always manifest<br> symptoms right away, any new cat entering a household—and any sick cat—should be<br> tested for FeLV.</p>
